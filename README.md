# SpaceMC Docker
Docker image used in all SpaceMC minecraft plugins. <br/>
We are using awesome [itzg/minecraft-server](https://docker-minecraft-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for PaperMC server in Docker.

> **Important**
>
> This image is created for our use, so we won't support 
> features that we don't need. So we only support **Maven**
> for automatic file movement.
